QGIS Arboriculture Toolkit

The QGIS Arboriculture Toolkit is designed as a starter pack for anyone looking to map trees, comprising a geopackage data model and QGIS project file for symbology, labelling and attribute forms. It is recommended to use the QGIS project file or layer files to ensure correct attribute values are used for the data model.
